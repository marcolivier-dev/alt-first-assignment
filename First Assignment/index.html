    <h2>Biography</h2> 
    <p>My name is Marc Olivier, and I was born in Port au Prince on December 24, 1997, into a family of 6 children. I'm a Haitian with a passion for technology and I'm convinced that it can be a catalyst for economic renewal in my country. I'm also a lover of music and literature.</p>

    <h3>Why Altschool Africa </h3>
    <p>I had decided to become a developer several years ago. I started to learn many times, but I often gave up along the way because I didn't have the right people around me. A mentor to encourage and support me.
        I had no one to ask my questions. And I didn't know what to learn specifically for each language. Which made it difficult for me to learn.
        I discovered your school via a youtube video that explained your founder's vision for Nigeria and Africa in general. Seeing a black man speak with such hope and optimism for Africa, his atypical background and his business successes greatly inspired me. 
        The school's fees seemed affordable, so I decided to apply and was selected.</p>

    <h4> My Goals</h4>
    <p> My goal is to become a developer. Create a company, inspire other young people to choose tech as a career because I'm convinced of its ability to create a great deal of wealth in my country, which has been suffering an economic crisis for over 10 years. </p>
